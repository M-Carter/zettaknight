# Zettaknight

Zettaknight is an open source automation utility aimed at simplifying the deployment and management of enterprise and other large-scale [OpenZFS](http://open-zfs.org/) implementations.  Testing/development is done mostly with [ZFS on Linux](http://zfsonlinux.org/), and on multiple OS distributions.

#### Disclaimer
We are working toward a stable first release.  The utility is usable in its current form, but still has some bugs and/or problems.  It is also seriously lacking in documentation.  Documentation on installation/usability is part of the roadmap for the first stable release.  We encourage use of the utility, and encourage reporting issues/bugs via Github Issues.
